.SYNOPSIS
    Liongard Agent REMOVAL - Production Ready (v1.0)
.DESCRIPTION
    - Detects Liongard Agent via Registry (Fast/Safe).
    - Stops Service -> Uninstalls via MSI -> Cleans Program Files.
    - RMM Safe: Runs silently if non-interactive.
    - Human Safe: Asks for confirmation if run manually (unless -Force is used).
